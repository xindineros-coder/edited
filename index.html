             Inside, the <head> element carries metadata, title, and links to styles or scripts, while the <body> part 
              holds the visible content. Headings (<h1>–<h6>), paragraphs (<p>), lists (<ul>, <ol>, <li>), links (<a>), 
                and pictures (<img>) are examples of HTML tags that are used to arrange material and give the page 
                structure and meaning. By integrating these tags, developers can construct well-organized, readable, 
                and accessible webpages. Web design is based on HTML, which makes it possible for browsers to display 
                content efficiently and reliably.">

           data-desc="CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) enhances HTML by controlling the visual presentation of web pages, 
           separating content from design. It allows developers to define colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and
            responsiveness, making pages more attractive and user-friendly. The main components of CSS syntax include
             selectors, which target HTML elements; properties, which specify what aspect to style (e.g., color, 
             font-size); and values, which define the style applied (e.g., red, 16px). CSS can be applied inline, 
             internally, or externally to improve consistency and maintainability. By using CSS, developers can create 
             visually appealing designs, responsive layouts for different devices, and a better overall user experience, 
             transforming plain HTML into professional and engaging webpages.">
